# FPGA Implementation of the MSM Pippengers algorithm

We have implemented an FPGA design that runs on an AWS F1 instance and can compute
the MSM of a large number of elliptic point and scalar pairs on the BLS12-377 G1
curve. 

Performance is measured as per the ZPrize specs at 20.504s for 4 rounds of
2<sup>26</sup> MSMs, which equates to **13.092** Mop/s.

Detailed instructions on re-creating these results from source are in the
[building from source](#building-the-design-from-source) and more detailed
measurement results in the [benchmarking](#benchmarking) sections below.


## Overview of the architecture

We have implemented a heavily optimized version of [Pippenger's 
algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0209022) in order to solve the MSM
problem.

We picked window sizes of between 12 and 13 bits, which allowed for efficient
mapping to FPGA URAM resources which are natively 4096 elements deep. Points are
transformed and pre-loaded into DDR-4, so that at run time only scalars are sent
from the host to the FPGA via PCIe. We implemented a single fully-pipelined
point adder on the FPGA which adds points to buckets as directed by the
controller until there are no more points left. The controller automatically
handles stalls (only accessing a bucket when it does not already have an
addition in-flight). Once all points have been added into buckets, the FPGA
streams back the result for the host to do the final (much smaller) triangle
summation. This approach allows us to focus on implementing a very high
performance adder on the FPGA (as these additions dominate Pippenger's
algorithm), and then leaving smaller tasks for the host to perform.

The above description overly simplifies the amount of optimizations and tricks we
have implemented to get performance. A summary of the optimizations are listed
out below.

## Key optimizations

 1. Early on we decided rather than implementing all of Pippenger's algorithm on
the FPGA, it would be better to only implement point additions, and focus on as
high throughput as possible. We implemented a fully pipelined adder which can
take new inputs to add every clock cycle, with a result appearing on the output
after 238 clock cycles in the final version.

 2. Implementing an adder on affine or projective coordinates requires more FPGA
resources (DSPs, LUTs, carry chains, ...), so we investigated different
transforms we could do in advance that would reduce the complexity on the FPGA.
We ended up deciding to transform to a scaled twisted Edwards curve and a
coordinate system loosely based on extended coordinates, but with heavy
precomputation. This [document describes the the details of the
transformation](docs/optimizing_point_representation.md)
The pre-transformation from affine points on a Weierstrass curve to extended 
projective points on an equivalent twisted Edwards curve significantly decreases 
the computational complexity of point addition (removing some modulo adds and a
modulo multiplication by constant, compared to the vanila mixed addition formulae
for scaled twisted edwards curve).

    This transformation requires special care as there are 5 points on the Weierstrass 
    curve that cannot map to our selected twisted Edwards curve. This is such a rare 
    edge case that in generating 2<sup>26</sup> random points we never hit one, but 
    we add a check in our driver to detect these and perform point multiplication on 
    the host if needed. Corner case tests confirm this code works as expected.

 3. We mask PCIe latency by allowing MSM operations to start while points are
  being streamed in batches from the host. When a result is being processed we
  are also able to start the MSM on the next batch.

 4. Multiplier optimizations in the Barrett reduction algorithm so that constants
    require less FPGA resources.

 5. Instead of performing a full Barrett reduction or full modular addition/subtraction, we perform 
 a coarse reduction and allow additive error to accumulate through our point adder. Then, we correct 
 this error all at once using BRAMs as ROMs to store coefficients that can be used to reduce values
 in the range $[0,512q]$ to their modular equivalents in $[0,q]$.

 6. Selecting a bucket size that allows for efficient usage of FPGA URAM,
  allowing non-uniform bucket sizes, and pblocking windows to separate SLRs in
  the FPGA to avoid routing congestion.

 7. Scalars are converted into signed form and our twisted Edwards point adder is
    modified to support point subtraction, which allows all bucket memory to be
    reduced in half.

 8. Host code is optimized to allow for offloading the final triangle sum and
    bucket doubling operations.

## Resource utilization

The AWS shell uses roughly 20% of the resources available on the FPGA. We tuned
our MSM implementation to use the remaining resources as much as possible while
still being able to successfully route in Vivado.

# Building the design from source

Instructions are given below for building from source. A prerequisite is that
OCaml has been setup (outlined in the main [README.md](../../README.md)).

It is important you use the AMI version 1.10.5 and Vivado version 2020.2 to
acheive the same results. The rtl_checksum expected of the Verilog when
generated from the Hardcaml source is 1929f78e1e4bafd9cf88d507a3afa055.

## Compiling the BLS12-377 reference

Run `cargo build` in `libs/rust/ark_bls12_377_g1` to compile the dynamic library
exposing a reference implementation of the BLS12-377 g1 curve. This is
necessary for the expect tests to work expectedly.

z3 should also be installed to run tests.

## Generating the Verilog from Hardcaml

The following instructions assume you are in the `zprize/msm_pippenger` folder.

The Hardcaml code can be built by calling `dune build`, which will also cause
the top level Verilog to be generated in
`fpga/krnl_msm_pippenger/krnl_msm_pippenger.v`. We also provide a dune target
for generating an md5sum `fpga/krnl_msm_pippenger/rtl_checksum.md5` of the
Verilog expected, so that if changes to the Hardcaml source are made that modify
the Verilog (which is not checked into the repo), the rtl-checksum will show a
difference.

### Simulations in Hardcaml

We have various expect tests in the [test folders](hardcaml/test) which can be
run by calling `dune runtest`. To optionally run a longer simulation, we added
binaries that can be called and various arguments set. These run with the
[Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/verilator/) backend, which after a longer
compile time, will provide much faster simulation time than the built-in
Hardcaml simulator. Make sure you have Verilator installed when running this
binary. To simulate 128 random points, run the following command:

```
dune exec ./hardcaml/bin/simulate.exe -- kernel -num-points 128 -verilator -timeout 1000000
```

The `-waves` switch can be optionally provided to open the simulation in the
hardcaml waveform viewer. A larger timeout should be provided when simulating
more points.

## Building an FPGA image for AWS

You need to clone the [aws-fpga repo](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga/), as well
as run on an AWS box with the [FPGA Developer
AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-gimv3gqbpe57k) installed.

```
source ~/aws-fpga/vitis_setup.sh
```

Cd into the `fpga` directory which contains the scripts to build an actual FPGA
design (takes 6-8 hours), or a emulation module (takes 15 minutes). Both of
these scripts below will build the Hardcaml to generate the required Verilog.

```
cd fpga
./compile_hw.sh
```

### Running a hardware emulation simulation

You can also optionally run a Vivado simulation of the design which includes the
AWS shell and DDR-4 logic. This takes a lot longer than the Hardcaml simulation
above but provides a more true-to-hardware test enviroment.

```
cd fpga
./compile_hw_emu.sh
```

Once the emulation image is built run this command. You can optionally modify
xrt.template.ini if you want to enable GUI:

```
cd /test
./run_hw_emu.sh
```

If you want the Vivado GUI over the ssh to AWS, you need to install:

```
yum install libXtst.x86_64
```

### Creating the AWS AFI

Once you have successfully called `compile_hw.sh` in the `fpga` folder, you want
to pass the results to the AWS script responsible for generating the AFI an
end-user can run:

```
./compile_afi.sh
```

After running the `compile_afi.sh` script, there should be a folder 'afi/'. Get
the afi id from the file `afi/{date}_afi_id.txt` and run the following command
to track the progress of its creation:

```
aws ec2 describe-fpga-images --fpga-image-ids <afi-...>
```
Which will show up as "available" when the image is ready to use.

# Benchmarking

## AWS setup

You need to run these steps on an AWS F1 box with an FPGA. Make sure you have
cloned the aws-fpga repo and run:

```
source ~/aws-fpga/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
```

Optionally check the status of the FPGA:

```
systemctl status mpd
```

You need the .awsxclbin file from the build box - usually the easiest way is to
download this from the s3 bucket or scp it over.

## Running the MSM

See the the test\_harness [README.md](test_fpga_harness/README.md) for detailed
instructions on benchmarking our solution against 2<sup>26</sup> to get the
performance number required for the ZPrize competition. The following sections
present a summary of those results.

## AFI-ids and measured performance

### Notes for ZPrize judges

AFI used for benchmarking: afi-0938ad46413691732.

The image built from the source at the time of writing will produce an FPGA
AFI that runs at 278MHz, automatically clocked down from 280MHz by Vitis. We
have also provided this AFI we built and tested with in the home directory of
the fpga (runner) box, as well as in the s3 bucket provided to us in a `/afis`
folder.

## The test harness

We took the test harness written in Rust for the GPU track and implemented
against the same API for testing our FPGA implementation.

Detailed instructions for running the test harness can be found in
[test\_fpga\_harness](test_fpga_harness/README.md). Note each of these tests
take up to 30min each as we transform 2<sup>26</sup> affine points into their
twisted Edwards representation. A summary of the commands and their output is
given here.

The following command will time and verify the result for 4 rounds of
2<sup>26</sup> MSM:

```
cd test_fpga_harness
CMAKE=cmake3 XCLBIN=~/afi-0938ad46413691732.awsxclbin TEST_LOAD_DATA_FROM=~/testdata/2_26 cargo test  --release -- --nocapture
```

Output to show the latency of 4 rounds and correctness:

```
Running MSM of [67108864] input points (4 batches)
Streaming input scalars across 4 chunks per batch (Mask IO and Post Processing)
Running multi_scalar_mult took Ok(20.504301742s) (round = 0)
test msm_correctness ... ok
```

We also benchmark the result to eliminate noise and get a more accurate
measurement. Below is the total time for the same measurement as above but
repeated 10 times

```
cd test_fpga_harness
CMAKE=cmake3 XCLBIN=~/afi-0938ad46413691732.awsxclbin TEST_LOAD_DATA_FROM=~/testdata/2_26 cargo bench
```

Output to show the result of 10 runs of 4 rounds each:

```
FPGA-MSM/2**26x4        time:  [20.404 s 20.504 s 20.621 s]
```

We achieve a mean of 20.504s, which equates to **13.092** Mop/s
((4*2^26)/1000000)/20.504).

### Power

AWS allows the average power to be measured during operation:

```
sudo fpga-describe-local-image -S 0 -M
```
```
Power consumption (Vccint):
   Last measured: 51 watts
   Average: 50 watts
   Max measured: 54 watts
```

### Breakdown of individual host steps

The breakdown of how long each stage takes can be printed when changed the value
of `mask_io` to `false` in `host/driver/driver.cpp` (this is not used in
benchmarking as it has lower performance):

```
[memcpy-ing scalars to special memory region] 0.28928s
[transferring scalars to gmem] 0.198263s
[Doing FPGA Computation] 4.96781s
[Copying results back from gmem] 0.00128217s
[Doing on-host postprocessing] 0.469954s
```

### Notes
 1. Because our solution offloads a non-trival amount of work to the host 
 to perform in parallel, you will see the best performance after a fresh reboot,
and without other CPU-intensive tasks running at the same time.
 2. When running the tests, if you terminate the binary early by `ctrl-c`, it
will leave the FPGA in a bad state which requires clearing and re-programming
with these commands:

```
sudo fpga-clear-local-image  -S 0
sudo fpga-load-local-image -S 0 -I <afig-...>
```

# Debuging

## Running `host_buckets.exe` debug test

`host_buckets.exe` is a debug application that pumps test vectors into the FPGA
from a file, and compares against a reference file. Note this is NOT the
benchmarking program and has not been optimized in anyway. For actual runs and
benchmarking, please look in [test_fpga_harness](test_fpga_harness) and/or see
the benchmarking section above.

Firstly, compile the host binaries:

```bash
cd host
mkdir build/
cd build/

# Need to explicitly use cmake3 in the aws box, since it's running a pretty old
# centos
cmake3 ..
make -j

# Now, generate the test vectors. This just needs to be done once. Here's an
# example for debugging with 50k points
dune build @../../hardcaml/bin/default
../../hardcaml/bin/tools.exe test-vectors \
  -num-points 50_000 \
  -input-filename inputs-50_000.txt \
  -output-filename outputs-50_000.txt \
  -seed 1

# Now, run the actual binary. It should say "TEST PASSED" in the end. If you
# see verbose test output with things that looks like coordinates, your test
# probably failed.
./driver/host_buckets \
  path/to/msm_pippenger.link.awsxclbin \
  inputs-50000.txt \
