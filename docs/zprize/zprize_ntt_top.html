As such the design is provided as Vitis kernels which are put together to provide the final architecture.</p><p>There are 2 kernels involved:</p><ul><li><a href="zprize_ntt_hardcaml_kernel.html">Hardcaml RTL kernel</a> implementing the core NTT algorithm</li><li><a href="zprize_ntt_cpp_kernel.html">C++ HLS kernel</a> which sequences PCIe and HBM memory accesses</li></ul><h3 id="memory-bandwidth-and-streaming"><a href="#memory-bandwidth-and-streaming" class="anchor"></a>Memory bandwidth and streaming</h3><p>THe 4 step algorithm requires both a coloumn and row transform, with transposes between phases. This is performed both by controlling the memory access pattern (normal layout build) or by pre and post processing the input/output matrices (optimized layout builds).</p><p>One significant issue we have faced with this project is the bandwidth performance of HBM. In normal layouts, we tend to burst 64 to 512 bytes before opening a new row. The row open operation appears to be taking upto 200-250 HBM clock cycles (about 100 cycle at our internal 200 Mhz clock). We had expected significantly better performance from HBM than this and lacked time to try tuning varios HBM parameters to see if we could get better performance.</p><p>The optimized layouts use the host for pre/post processing and dramaticlly improve bandwidth efficiency - the smallest transfers are now 2048 - 4096 bytes (which is only for one read phase - the other read/write phases are completely linear).</p><p>We see tremendously improved through put of the core with this scheme, though we expect it to be judged harshly in this competition due to the extra pre/post processing step. We include it none-the-less as it shows the potential performance we can get to with either a more optimised HBM structure, or different memory architecture (like DDR4).</p><h3 id="throughput"><a href="#throughput" class="anchor"></a>Throughput</h3><p>We now show the result of 6 designs which target differing parallelism and memory architectures.</p><p>Note that each core instantiated has a throughput of approximately one INNT per second at our target 200 Mhz.</p>
